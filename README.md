# Ably playground
The Ably Playground is a (very work-in-progress) showcase of the many use-cases you can power with Ably and other great tools.

## Getting set up

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Run `cp .env.example .env`
3. Add your Ably api key to the `.env`
4. Start the server with `npm run server`
5. Start the client with `npm run client`
